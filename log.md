# Research Log

## 2026-11-01 (Day 1)
- Laptop model: Acer Nitro ANV15-52
- GPU:NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 (plus intel  UHD   Graphics)
- VRAM:8 GB 
- driver:621.01
- RAM:16.0GB(15.7GB usable)
- Free disk space:275 GB
- Python:3.12.10 
- Git versions:2.56.0.windows.4
- CUDA UMD Version: 13.5

## Notes
Day1:
- Did today: set up the project folder in VS Code, created the GitHub repo, pushed the first commit
- Broke / confusing: misspelled GitHub username in the remote address (oss vs ocs); push blocked by email privacy (GH007), fixed with the noreply address; data.lnk was a shortcut, not a folder
- Next: Day 2, create the virtual environment and install PyTorch for the RTX 5060

Day2:
- Did today:Activated `.venv`, installed PyTorch 2.11.0 with CUDA 12.8 support, verified GPU tensor math on the RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (8124 MB VRAM, sm_120), exported dependencies to requirements.txt, and pushed commit 6ca1e38 to GitHub.
- Broke / confusing: none
- Next:Day 3, NumPy + OpenCV
